simple session manager for firefox 100+ (tested on ff134)

![GitHub Logo](screenshot.png)


This addon does a few things: 

- circumvents lost session after a firefox crash, whcih happens very rarely but happens.
- lets you save, restore and append the browser session or individual browser windows
- lets you rename and edit sessions in a convinient ui
- keeps a history of recent sessions in a menu
   

this addon is part of my "tab-trio" of addons which i need for a complete workflow !
