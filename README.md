simple session manager for firefox 100+ (tested on ff134)

![GitHub Logo](screenshot.png)


This addon does a few things: 

- circumvents lost session after a firefox crash, whcih happens very rarely but happens. It keeps a backup of firefox's own restore point. 
- lets you save, restore and append the browser session or individual browser windows in nice menu 
- lets you rename and edit sessions in a convinient ui
- keeps a history of recent sessions in a menu
